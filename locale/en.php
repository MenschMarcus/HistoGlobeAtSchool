A scoring system and the editors of <span class="hg">HistoGlobe</span> guarantee a high reliability source of information.</p>
        <p>History is a controversial topic, so <span class="hg">HistoGlobe</span> is inviting to open dialogue and discussion. For each event, various sources can be weighed against each other and different representations can be proposed. This makes <span class="hg">HistoGlobe</span> a comprehensive collection of different viewpoints on the history of our world.</p>',

        <p>The idea was born in 2008 at a small high school in the province of East Germany. The motivation was the need of history teachers to hang a new world map on the map stand for each new period of time - though all maps showed the same earth, only with different borders, country names, symbols, and time stamps on it. This led to the vision of a teaching material which uses the same map, just with different historical events and changing political borders.</p>
        <p>Since 2010, the <span class="hg">HistoGlobe</span> project is continuously developed in different parts of Europe. <a href="http://www.histoglobe.com/old" target="_blank">The current prototype</a> was developed in the project course of Åbo Akademi in Turku (Finland) in winter 2011/2012. The former project group, consisting of six international students, won two public awards and the award for the Best Presentation in the project competition <a href="https://research.it.abo.fi/news-and-events/stories/ict-showroom-is-an-annual-event-for-student-projects" target="_blank">ICT Showroom 2012</a> with <span class="hg">HistoGlobe</span>.</p>',
