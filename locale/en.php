    	<p><span class="hg">HistoGlobe</span> is a nonprofit project that is committed to 
    	improve historical education using the achievements of technology to make history 
    	accessible and tangible. <span class="hg">HistoGlobe</span> also believes in swarm 
    	intelligence and wants to create a platform for a global community of history enthusiasts.
    	</p><p>
    	The idea was born in 2008 at a small high school in the province of East Germany. 
    	The motivation was the need of history teachers to hang a new world map on the map 
    	stand for each new period of time - though all maps showed the same earth, only with 
    	different borders, country names, symbols, and time stamps on it. This led to the 
    	vision of a teaching material which uses the same map, just with different historical 
    	events and changing political borders.
    	</p><p>
    	Since 2010, the <span class="hg">HistoGlobe</span> project is continuously developed 
    	in different parts of Europe. <a href="http://www.histoglobe.com/old" target="_blank">
    	The current prototype</a> was developed in the project course of Åbo Akademi in Turku 
			(Finland) in winter 2011/2012. The former project group, consisting of six international 
			students, won two public awards and the award for the Best Presentation in the project
