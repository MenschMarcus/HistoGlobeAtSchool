\section{User Interface Elements}
The interface consists of five main elements: The \textbf{Map} is the central element showing the current countries with their names and their borders and the position of historical events, calles \textbf{Hivents} happening around the current date. This date is set on the \textbf{Timeline} which allows to control the temporal dimension: Set a new date and see the status of this day in history on the map. There are also \textbf{Topic Bars} on top of the timeline showing historical epochs in a specific time period. The sidebar on the right contains a \textbf{Search Bar} for retrieving information about historical events and a \textbf{Hivent List} for hivents of the selected topic. If an hivent is selected, there is a \textbf{Hivent Box} opening presenting the name, a short description and an image or video about the Hivent. Additionally there are \textbf{Control Buttons} for zooming the map or timeline, toggling the full screen or high contrast modus for better readability in problematic lighting conditions in the classroom.
