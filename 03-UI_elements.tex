\section{User Interface Elements} % (fold)
\label{sec:user_interface_elements}

The interface consists of five main elements: The \textbf{Map} is the central element showing the current countries with their names and their borders and the position of historical events, called \textbf{Hivents} happening around the current date. This \textbf{NowDate} is set on the \textbf{Timeline} which allows to control the temporal dimension: Set a new date and see the status of this day in history on the map. Moving the timeline here and back wil reaveal the historical changes on the map. There are also \textbf{Topic Bars} on top of the timeline showing historical topics in a specific time period. The sidebar on the right contains a \textbf{Search Bar} for finding Hivents and a \textbf{Hivent List} of everything that happened in the selected topic. If an Hivent is selected, a \textbf{Hivent Box} pops up presenting the name, a short description and an image or video about the Hivent. Additionally there are \textbf{Control Buttons} for zooming the map or timeline, toggling the full screen or high contrast mode for better readability in problematic lighting conditions in the classroom.
