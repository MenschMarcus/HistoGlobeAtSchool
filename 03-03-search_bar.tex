\subsection{Search Bar}

One way to retrieve information about historical events is our search bar, which is a single-line text box with the dedicated function of accepting user input to be searched for. The user is able to search for events, people, places and time.

One or more possible matches are immediately displayed while the user is typing text. So the search is sent automatically to present the user with real-time results which are displayed as a drop-down list. This often allows the user to stop short of typing the entire word they were looking for.
